# Stephan Köstlbacher

Hi, I’m Stephan – an evolutionary biologist and bioinformatics scientist based in Vienna. I specialize in phylogenomics, comparative genomics, and AI-driven biology. My work bridges evolutionary insights and big data, from protein structures to genome evolution, mostly using Python, R, and modern workflow tools.

- **Pet project:** [@stephkoest/witchi](https://github.com/stephkoest/witchi) – efficient detection and pruning of compositional bias in phylogenomic alignments.
- **Last post:** Postdoc @ Wageningen University (NL), focusing on the evolution of cellular complexity and functional genomics.
- **Background:** Biology by training, coder by necessity.
- **Interests:** Structure-based protein discovery, functional genomics, and making sense of biological complexity with code and curiosity.
- **Fun fact:** Either chasing hypertrophy or divine orbs in PoE2.
